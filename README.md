The real-time monitoring system developed in Python and Tkinter. The purpose of this app is to monitor system resources in real time, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and processes running on the system. The app is directed toward users that want to monitor system usage performance, identify resource-heavy applications, and end applications. The app updates system stats continuously and displays them using user-friendly progress bars and tables. This app returns and displays all processes which appear in memory, along with their memory/CPU usage, which can be terminated with minimal effort. The app also has a resource hog feature which actively detects processes that are using too much CPU or memory, then highlights them for termination. psutil is a library that is used to collect system statics and can update continuously to provide current and reliable statistics. The Simple System Monitor is user-friendly and easy to navigate, providing real time monitoring and health of system use, and will optimize the way your system operates at home and in practice.
